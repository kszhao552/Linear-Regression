This is a simple script designed to make calculations for values related to linear regressions easier.

The program is designed to take in two vectors as input and will print out values related to the regression, including xbar, ybar, bhat1, bhat2, SSxx, SSxy, etc. The output will be written into a .txt file in case the data needs to be used in the future. The x, y, predicted y, and error lists will be placed into a csv file to be read easily.
