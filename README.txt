This is a simple script designed to make calculations for values related to linear regressions easier.

The program is designed to take in two vectors as input and will print out values related to the regression, including xbar, ybar, bhat1, bhat2, SSxx, SSxy, etc. The output will be written into a .txt file in case the data needs to be used in the future. The x, y, predicted y, and error lists will be placed into a csv file to be read easily.
To use the script, place all the .py files into the same directory. The script will prompt you the input the data values. After that, the output files will be placed in the same directory as the script.
